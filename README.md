# Know More (No More Ideas)

What are the courses actually going to be about?

## Plan of Attack

1. Build a agent-enhanced course delivery system

But why?

Participants can live code with a teacher agent. Its an AI study partner.

## Ideas of how to start

- Define demographic
- Develop 10 questions to figure out the pain points in that demographic

## Course Ideas

- Each aspect of building a business/product
-

## Assumptions

Audience is interested in tech/business.
Also, interested in improvement, learning new things.
Could be from all walks of life, trying to level up.

## Value We can provide

Step by step approach to building a business/product.

## MVP

## Concerns

Will people actually buy our course?
Will they want this enhanced course taking experience with special AI agent/teacher that assists during the course.

## The "Teachers Assistant" Agent

Some interesting ideas:

- Rehearsing pitching
- Rehearsing Client/pre-sales interactions

## Axioms - No More Ideas

0. Pick an idea. (Your ideas dont matter as much as you think, time + execution + demand matter.)
1. Ship fast and often. (Commitment to commits.)
2.

## Build it for ourselves

## ColdCallAI, Make custom AIs for people to voice call with. CallMe. We create your customer support, teachers assistant.

### Agent Phase One

Bare mimimum of the platform is a basic teaching agent using LiveKit.
Rev1 we dogfood the agent with some ideas of "who we are" or "the authority with which we speak"
Humans are flawed, the idea is the AI will be "less flawed" where it counts.

First thing we have to do is create a course.

#### Def of Done

We have made a video. -- need to decide on what this first video would be
We feed an "agent", platform that can spawn agents with embeddings of X GB of data.
We have an web UI where viewers can join a voice call with agent which would constantly be listening and responding in pure conversational format (\*\*Sam thinks is unrealistic to accomplish quickly)
This agent would just be there to assist with assignments or study agents.
Embeddings are persisted.
Platform to manage accounts, liscense etc, CRUD for agents, embeddings upload functionality.

#### Questions

How does the user interact

#### Assumptions

LLMs are more conversational than technical
This agent will not be perfect, but it will at least exist where no agents have existed in this space.

#### Challenges

I think RAG sucks, and I also think LLMs arent saving us more time and money yet.
ITs an illusion of productivity, 80/20 rule pitfall.
Where AI does the first 80% perfectly, and you spent another 80% of time yourself finishing the 20% it will never be able to know or perform correctly.

Does copilot help? Does AI help? Of course it does on some level, just gotta figure out if theres money to be sqozen out of it at our level.

### Expansion Phase - Content Creator Agents

We are creating content on YT to entertain, educate. We have our words and our likenesses. We could make teachers agents that sounds exactly like us. We can prime it with all the context, and heres how I talk and my manurishms. Its an agent in our likeness, that could come online and listen to me talk, but could "take me home" and ask follow up questions.
